          IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING ARBITRATION: WHEN YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS
          YOU ARE AGREEING (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE

        </Typography>
        <Typography>12. Limitation of Liability.</Typography>
        <Typography>
          (a) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NEITHER JACKPOT NOR ITS
          SERVICE PROVIDERS INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE
          SITE WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR
          CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUES,
          LOST SAVINGS, LOST BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF DATA OR GOODWILL,
          SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF
          SUBSTITUTE SERVICES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
          THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE, WHETHER
          BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT
          LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT JACKPOT OR ITS
          SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
          DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE
          FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (b) TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL JACKPOT’S
          TOTAL LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR
          FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S.
          DOLLARS ($100).
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (c) THE EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS OF DAMAGES SET FORTH ABOVE ARE
          FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN JACKPOT AND
          YOU.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          13. Governing Law and Forum Choice. These Terms and any action related
          thereto will be governed by the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act, federal
          arbitration law, and the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
          to its conflict of laws provisions. Except as otherwise expressly set
          forth in Section 14 “Dispute Resolution,” the exclusive jurisdiction
          for all Disputes (defined below) that you and Jackpot are not required
          to arbitrate will be the state and federal courts located in the State
          of Delaware, and you and Jackpot each waive any objection to
          jurisdiction and venue in such courts.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>14. Dispute Resolution.</Typography>
        <Typography>
          (a) Informal Resolution of Disputes. You and Jackpot must first
          attempt to resolve any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or
          relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement,
          interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services
          (collectively, “Disputes”) informally. Accordingly, neither you nor
          Jackpot may start a formal arbitration proceeding for at least sixty
          (60) days after one party notifies the other party of a claim in
          writing. As part of this informal resolution process, you must deliver
          your written notices via first-class mail to us at Jackpot, Attn: 24 W
          Main St, Ste 385 Clinton, CT 06413.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (b) Mandatory Arbitration of Disputes. We each agree that any Dispute
          will be resolved solely by binding, individual arbitration and not in
          a class, representative or consolidated action or proceeding. You and
          Jackpot agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the
          interpretation and enforcement of these Terms, and that you and
          Jackpot are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
          participate in a class action. This arbitration provision shall
          survive termination of these Terms.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (c) Exceptions. As limited exceptions to Section 14(b) above: (i) we
          both may seek to resolve a Dispute in small claims court if it
          qualifies; and (ii) we each retain the right to seek injunctive or
          other equitable relief from a court to prevent (or enjoin) the
          infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (d) Conducting Arbitration and Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will
          be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its
          Consumer Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as
          modified by these Terms. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or
          by calling 1-800-778-7879. A party who wishes to start arbitration
          must submit a written Demand for Arbitration to AAA and give notice to
          the other party as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA provides a form
          Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org. Any arbitration hearings will
          take place in the county (or parish) where you live, unless we both
          agree to a different location. The parties agree that the arbitrator
          shall have exclusive authority to decide all issues relating to the
          interpretation, applicability, enforceability and scope of this
          arbitration agreement.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (e) Arbitration Costs. Payment of all filing, administration and
          arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, and we won’t seek
          to recover the administration and arbitrator fees we are responsible
          for paying, unless the arbitrator finds your Dispute frivolous. If we
          prevail in arbitration, we’ll pay all of our attorneys’ fees and costs
          and won’t seek to recover them from you. If you prevail in arbitration
          you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to
          the extent provided under applicable law.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (f) Injunctive and Declaratory Relief. Except as provided in Section
          14(c) above, the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on
          the merits of any claim asserted by either party and may award
          declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party
          seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief
          warranted by that party’s individual claim. To the extent that you or
          we prevail on a claim and seek public injunctive relief (that is,
          injunctive relief that has the primary purpose and effect of
          prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the public),
          the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a
          civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The
          parties agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive
          relief shall be stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any
          individual claims in arbitration.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (g) Class Action Waiver. YOU AND JACKPOT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING
          CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND
          NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
          REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, if the parties’ Dispute is
          resolved through arbitration, the arbitrator may not consolidate
          another person’s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise
          preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this
          specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of
          this Dispute Resolution section shall be null and void.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (h) Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in
          Section 14(g) of these Terms (“Class Action Waiver”), if an arbitrator
          or court of competent jurisdiction decides that any part of these
          Terms is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of these Terms will
          still apply.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>15. General Terms.</Typography>
        <Typography>
          (a) Reservation of Rights. Jackpot and its licensors exclusively own
          all right, title and interest in and to the Site, including all
          associated intellectual property rights. You acknowledge that the Site
          is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of the United
          States and other jurisdictions. You agree not to remove, alter or
          obscure any copyright, trademark, service mark or other proprietary
          rights notices incorporated in or accompanying the Site.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (b) Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive
          understanding and agreement between Jackpot and you regarding the
          Site, and these Terms supersede and replace all prior oral or written
          understandings or agreements between Jackpot and you regarding the
          Site. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable
          by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced
          to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these
          Terms will remain in full force and effect. Except where provided by
          applicable law in your jurisdiction, you may not assign or transfer
          these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Jackpot’s prior
          written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms
          absent our consent or your statutory right, without such consent, will
          be null. Jackpot may freely assign or transfer these Terms without
          restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure
          to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (c) Notices. Any notices or other communications provided by Jackpot
          under these Terms will be given by posting to the Site.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          (d) Waiver of Rights. Jackpot’s failure to enforce any right or
          provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right
          or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be
          effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized
          representative of Jackpot. Except as expressly set forth in these
          Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these
          Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these
          Terms or otherwise.
        </Typography>
        <Typography>
          16. Contact Information. If you have any questions about these Terms
          or the Site, please contact Jackpot at [ admin@getjackpot.xyz ].
